    <h1><b>Internet Protocols and IP Address</b></h1>
    <p>
        <b>Internet Protocols (IP)</b> are a set of rules that govern how data is sent and received over the internet.
        Their main <b>function</b> is to ensure devices can communicate and route data correctly across networks.
        Common protocols include:
        <b>HTTP</b> (HyperText Transfer Protocol), <b>HTTPS</b> (Secure HTTP), <b>FTP</b> (File Transfer Protocol),
        <b>TCP/IP</b> (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), and <b>SMTP</b> (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
    </p>

    <h2><b>Types and Versions of IP Addresses</b></h2>
    <p>
        <b>IP addresses</b> are unique identifiers assigned to devices on a network to facilitate communication.
        There are two main versions of IP addresses: <b>IPv4</b> and <b>IPv6</b>.
        <b>IPv4</b> uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing for about 4.3 billion addresses, while <b>IPv6</b> uses a 128-bit scheme,
        offering a vastly larger address space to meet modern demands.
        <b>IPv4</b> is still widely used, but <b>IPv6</b> is essential for expanding networks like IoT and mobile services.
